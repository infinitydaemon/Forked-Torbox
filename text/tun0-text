This menu entry supposes that TorBox is connected with the internet
through a VPN connection using the interface tun0. There are two
possibilities of how TorBox handles VPN connections:

1. The VPN connection is already established, and the interface tun0 is
   configured.

2. The VPN connection is not established yet, but one ore more *.ovpn
   - files are in the ~/openvpn directory so that TorBox can execute
   OpenVPN with that file.

IMPORTANT
- We do NOT recommend using a VPN. If Tor entry guards cannot be reached
  for censorship reasons, we recommend using OBFS4 bridges as a priority
  (main menu entry 11). We consider a VPN connection as a last resort.
- Nevertheless, we consider the additional risk of this "Tor over VPN"
  situation to be proportionate - see here: https://bit.ly/31lUhLQ

The next step is to set up TorBox so that your client devices have access
through TorBox's wireless network (wlan0) and/or through Ethernet (eth0).
In the second case, please plug in the ethernet cable with your client
device NOW.

If we have to restart TorBox's wireless network, please reconnect your
client without closing the ssh session. Usually, the configuration
continuous -- if not, then please repeat the process.
