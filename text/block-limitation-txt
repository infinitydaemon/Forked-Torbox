This menu entry will block HTTP plain text traffic by blocking port 80.

WARNING!
- This is only a very superficial block, which could help if, for example,
  a browser requests an unencrypted Webpage (http://). Currently, it DOES
  NOT block plain text traffic in general (for example, Telnet).
- HTTP plain text traffic from clients using TorBox's SOCKS 5 functionality
  or the Tor Browser CANNOT be blocked.
- CHROM and CHROMIUM: .onion addresses using "http://" will be blocked.
- It is possible because not only unencrypted Webpages but also other
  traffic on port 80 are blocked, that some application will not work
  correctly anymore.

Would you like to enable the HTTP plain text traffic anyway?
