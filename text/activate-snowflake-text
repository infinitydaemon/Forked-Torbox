SNOWFLAKE circumvents sophisticated censorship. In contrast to the OBFS4 bridges (see menu entries above), SNOWFLAKE is based on another technique, which should also work for users in China.

You should only activate SNOWFLAKE, if necessary and if OBFS4 bridges don't work. SNOWFLAKE could lead to a slower data transfer speed. However, SNOWFLAKE seems to be more performant than MEEK-AZURE. By default, SNOWFLAKE is deactivated.

IMPORTANT
- This menu entry activates SNOWFLAKE to bypass Tor blocking in a
  country. It helps to circumvent censorship; however, it doesn't help if
  a firewall blocks the network traffic.
- OBFS4 BRIDGE and BRIDGE RELAY MODE will automatically be deactivated;
  the configuration will be kept for later re-activation.
- The countermeasure against tightly configured firewalls will
  automatically be deactivated, and local clearnet DNS resolution will
	be activated. However, this is not a problem because all clients'
	DNS requests are still handled through Tor.
- Ignore all the error messages. At the end, you should see
  "Bootstrapped 100%: Done".
- Tor Statistics (and probably some other tools) will not work under
  SNOWFLAKE.
