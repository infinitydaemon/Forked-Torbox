This menu entry deactivates TorBox's ONION SERVICE MODE, which is the default.

However, the configured Onion Services, client authorizations, hosted data will not be deleted and the actual configuration preserved. If you activate the ONION SERVICE MODE again, the same configuration will be applied -- no need to worry ;-)

At the end, Tor automatically restarts.

Would you like to DEACTIVATE TorBox's ONION SERVICE MODE?
