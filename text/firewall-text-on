Most likely, a tightly configured firewall stays in the way of a proper
working TorBox. Tor commonly uses ports 80, 443, 9001 and 9030 for
network traffic and directory information.

Activating the countermeasure against a tightly configured firewall takes
care that tor uses only port 80 and 443 for its data stream, which should
help with a tightly configured firewall.

IMPORTANT: THIS CAN LEAD TO PROBLEMS IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF BRIDGES
and DOESN'T WORK WITH AN OBFS4 BRIDGE RELAY simultaneously.

Do you want to activate the countermeasure against a tightly configured
firewall?
