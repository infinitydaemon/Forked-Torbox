   This menu entry disables temporary (until next reboot) or permanently
   (not recommended) TorBox's WLAN. It makes only sense and is only
   possible if your client is connected via Ethernet cable.

   ATTENTION: If you permanently disable TorBox's WLAN and start-up TorBox
   without an Ethernet cable, you will lock out yourself from accessing
   TorBox through WLAN.

   How do you want to disable TorBox's WLAN (ESC -> go back)?
