You did choose CAPTIVE PORTAL because the network provider, who facilitates the access to the Internet, confronts you with a login page (captive portal), which requires additional information (for example email, phone number, voucher number ...).

If you agree, first, we access the provider's login page directly through an INSECURE CONNECTION. Then we successfully undertake the login procedure on the provider's login page. Finally, we switch back to a SECURE CONNECTION with the Tor network.

        !!! WARNING !!! NEXT WE SWITCH TO AN INSECURE CONNECTION !!! 
            !!! CLOSE ALL APPLICATIONS ON YOUR CLIENT DEVICES !!!


Are you ready to continue to an INSECURE CONNECTION?
