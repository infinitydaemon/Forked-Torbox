Would you like to update your TorBox menu?

DEFAULT
The default and recommended way to update the TorBox menu with the latest
stable version (master branch from TorBox's GitHub repository)

EXPERT
Update the TorBox menu using a specific branch from TorBox's GitHub
repository. This is mainly used to test a yet unstable branch.

IMPORTANT
- This update is only recommended for minor updates within a major version.
  If you like to upgrade from one major version to another, we recommend
  downloading the new image file.
- By default, only the TorBox menu will be upgraded. To upgrade the
  configuration files additionally select menu entry 6.
- If you selected menu entry 6 to update / reset your TorBox configuration
  files, ALL configuration files would be overwritten, and all your custom
  configuration will be lost (we will not ask you a second time!)
