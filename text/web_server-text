This menu entry starts, stops or lists website folders on Onion domains. The difference to TorBox's File Sharing (TFS) capabilities (menu entry 13) is that TFS is focused on exchanging files, not serving a website.

IMPORTANT
- To share a website folder through an Onion domain, you have first to
  toggle the Onion Service Mode from OFF to ON and/or create an Onion
  Service (menu entry 2 or 3).
- Without client authorization (menu entry 7-11), you will share the
  website folder with ANYONE. If you don't want that, control the
  client's access first.

Do you want to start, stop or list website folders on Onion domains?
