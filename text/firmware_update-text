Would you really like to update the firmware of your Raspberry Pi 4?

IMPORTANT
- Use a reliable power supply.
- Don't remove power from your TorBox during the update.
- If something goes wrong, your EEPROM could be left corrupted, and the RPI4
  doesn't boot again. In such a case, download and apply the recovery 
  package: https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/
- You have to reboot the system at the end.
