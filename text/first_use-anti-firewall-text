We are sorry that the activation of tor with OBFS4 bridges failed. Most
likely, a tightly configured firewall stays in the way. TOR commonly uses
ports 80, 443, 9001 and 9030 for network traffic and directory information.

To solve the problem, the following approaches are possible:
- If you donâ€™t need OBFS4 bridges, then try to use TorBox without them.
- Open port 80, 443, 9001 and 9030 on your router.
- Try to use the firewall countermeasure, so that tor uses only
  port 80 and 443 for its data stream.

Do you want to try the anti-firewall countermeasure (recommended) or quit
to the Countermeasure sub-menu to deactivate or reconfigure OBFS4
respectively to activate MEEK-AZURE / SNOWFLAKE?
