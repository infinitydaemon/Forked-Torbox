Since 2021, the TorBox team observed more and more providers (especially
in connection with open hotspots), which extensively block ports, which
stays in the way of a proper working TorBox (tor commonly uses ports 80,
443, 9001 and 9030 for network traffic and directory information).

Therefore, TorBox uses by default countermeasures against a tightly
configured firewall taking care that tor uses only port 80 and 443
for its data stream.

IMPORTANT
- If using bridges, this can lead to problems (depending on the
  configuration of the bridges).
- Don't use this option if you want to run an OBFS4 BRIDGE RELAY! This
  will not work!

Do you want to keep using the countermeasure against tightly configured
firewalls?
