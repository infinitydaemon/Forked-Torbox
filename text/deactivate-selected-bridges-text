With this menu entry, you can DEACTIVATE selected OBFS4 BRIDGES from the Tor configuration.

2-STEP PROCEDURE
To deactivate selected OBFS4 bridges, you have to follow a 2-step procedure:
1. List all OBFS4 bridges and make a note of all bridge numbers you want
   to deactivate.
2. Continue with this menu entry and put in all bridge numbers separated
   by a comma, which you want to deactivate (for example 1,2,3,10)

IMPORTANT
If ALL OBFS4 bridges are deactivated, TorBox will directly connect to the Tor network, which is the default.
