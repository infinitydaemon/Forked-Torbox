This menu entry switches the access point (TorBox's WLAN) to 5 GHz.
Theoretically, this enables a bigger bandwidth between your clients and
the TorBox. However, usually, the bottle-neck lies in the Tor network.

ATTENTION: The use of the 5 GHz band has also disadvantages. Not all
devices support 5 GHz, consequently, and don't see the TorBox access
point. More critical: 5 GHz needs more power and is not recommended if you
use your TorBox on a weak power adapter or even with a Power Bank.

Do you want to switch to 5 GHz?
