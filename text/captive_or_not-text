There are two ways to connect with the Internet: OPEN ACCESS or CAPTIVE PORTAL.

OPEN ACCESS means that after TorBox is connected to the Internet via cable or a wireless connection (possibly with a password), you don't have to fill out an additional login/authentication page. Usually, this is the case when you are at home.

CAPTIVE PORTAL means that after TorBox is connected to the Internet via cable or a wireless connection (possibly without a password), you have to register yourself with additional information (for example, email, phone number, voucher number ...) on a login page (captive portal). This is often seen at airports and in hotels as well as Internet caf√©s...

Please choose how to connect to the Internet (if unsure, try CAPTIVE PORTAL - it is more complex but works in both cases):
