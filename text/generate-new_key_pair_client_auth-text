With a key pair (public and private key), access to an Onion Service can be limited to those with the specific private key.

This menu entry will generate a key pair (public and private key) where the private key is automatically stored to authorize you as a legit client. The public key should be sent to the Onion Service operator to give you access to the particular Onion Service.

If the Onion Service operator has already a key pair and gives you a private key, you can register it using menu entry 3.

Would you like to generate a key pair for a specific Onion Service?
