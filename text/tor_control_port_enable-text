For security reasons, the Tor control port is only used locally on the TorBox itself and is protected by a password.

If someone needs to control Tor from a client, he can enable the Tor control port access for clients.

IMPORTANT
- To take effect of the change, you must (re-)select the Internet connection
  in the Main Menu (entry 5-10).
- You are strongly advised to change the password of your Tor control port
  (entry 3 in the Configuration sub-menu).
- Enabled Tor control port access for clients generates warning messages
  in the Tor log.

Would you like to enable Tor control port access for clients?
