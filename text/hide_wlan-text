This menu entry hides the name of TorBox's WLAN. To connect it, its name
has to be known and enter manually.

However, except that the WLAN is not immediately visible, it DOES NOT
increase security. Someone with the right tools and enough time can sniff
the traffic and find the SSID. Another, probably more elegant solution,
is to blend into the neighborhood and to rename TorBox's WLAN accordingly.
For example: If you near a Starbucks coffee shop, why not call it
"Starbucks_"

Alternatively, in a high-risk situation, you can connect TorBox with an
Ethernet cable with your client and altogether disable TorBox's WLAN
(menu entry 8)
