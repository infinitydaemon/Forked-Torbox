Would you like to reset your TorBox configuration files?

IMPORTANT
- If not already done, we recommend updating TorBox's menu first by using
	menu entry 6. This will also provide you with the newest configuration
	files, stored in /home/torbox/torbox/etc.
- If you want to preserve the configuration for your OBFS4 bridge relay and
  for your Onion Services, you have to make these backups before. You can
	find the menu entries in the OBFS4 Bridge Relay and the Onion Service
	sub-menus.
- ALL configuration files will be overwritten, and ALL your custom
	configuration will be lost!!
