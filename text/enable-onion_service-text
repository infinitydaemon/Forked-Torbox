This menu entry creates or reactivates an Onion Service. To do so, you have to type in the name of the service. If the service is not existing, it will be created (including a shared folder). If the service exists, it may be deactivated. You can try to reactivate it.

Along with the Onion Service up to two virtual ports can be configured. However, for sharing a folder or files only one virtual port is necessary. So don't break your head about it, and just type in a number you wish to use (good numbers are 80, 8080, or something above 10000).

At the end, when the Onion Service is successfully created, TorBox will present you with all necessary information, including a QR-code.

IMPORTANT
- The newly created Onion Service is not accessible right away. You have
  still to share the newly created folder (menu entry 12 or 13). This
	method is a quick and good solution to share documents and websites
	statically.
- Without client authorization (menu entry 7-11), this shared folder will
  be publicly available. If you want to restrict the client's access,
  you have to generate a key pair (menu entry 7), send the client his
  private key or register a client's public key (menu entry 8) if he is
  providing you with it.
