This menu entry DELETES all or specific OBFS4 BRIDGES from TorBox. However, OBFS4 Bridges are necessary for TorBox to bypass Tor blocking in a country. To use this feature of TorBox, you need to have at least one OBFS4 bridge.

IMPORTANT
If you delete ALL OBFS4 bridges, TorBox will directly connect to the Tor network, which is the default. However, instead of deleting OBFS4 bridges, we recommend simply to deactivate them.
