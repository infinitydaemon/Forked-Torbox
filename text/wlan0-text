This menu entry supposes that TorBox should be connected to the Internet
through the onboard wireless chip supporting the 2.5 and 5 GHz band
(wlan0).

IMPORTANT
- Not all USB WiFi adapters work correctly as an Access Point (AP) - as
  simpler the adapter, as higher the chance for success. Especially, USB
  WiFi adapters supporting the 5 GHz band usually don't work correctly
  as an AP, and we recommend using main menu entry 5 instead or connecting
  the clients with an Ethernet cable (eth0).
- To avoid a user lockout situation, if the AP is not disabled in the
  Config sub-menu, the settings are automatically reset to the default
  values using the onboard wireless chip as AP.

The next step is to set up TorBox so that your client devices have access
through TorBox's wireless network (wlan1) and/or through Ethernet (eth0).
In the second case, please plug in the ethernet cable with your client
device NOW.

If we have to restart TorBox's wireless network, please reconnect your
client without closing the ssh session. Usually, the configuration
continuous -- if not, then please repeat the process.
