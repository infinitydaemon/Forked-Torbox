This menu entry will disconnect the TorBox from a VPN so that the local
network data from the command prompt is routed through your Internet
provider without a VPN (default). Client network data will always be
routed through Tor.

IMPORTANT
- This menu entry will not restart Tor and break your Tor connectivity
  if you route the Tor traffic through VPN. In this case just use
  another Internet source in the main menu (entry 4-9).

Would you like to CONTINUE?
