This menu entry disables temporary (until next
reboot) or permanently TorBox's WLAN. This makes
only sense and is only possible if your client is
connected via Ethernet cable.

Currently, no client is connected via Ethernet cable.
Please connect first a client with an Ethernet cable
to TorBox and try again.
