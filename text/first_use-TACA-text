We HIGHLY recommend activating TorBox's automatic counter actions (TACA)
and Vanguards. TACA avoids connection downtime to the tor network and
gives a better user experience, especially on connections with lower
bandwidth. Vanguards protects against Guard discovery and related traffic
analysis.

Choose with SPACE if you want to activate TACAT and/or Vanguards and then
press ENTER (ESC -> skip)
