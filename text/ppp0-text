This menu entry supposes that TorBox should be connected to the Internet
through a cellular link (ppp0, for example, the Sixfab Shields/HATs for
cellular connections) or an USB dongle (usb0). These interfaces have to
be configured BEFOREHAND.

The next step is to set up TorBox so that your client devices have access
through TorBox's wireless network (wlan0) and/or through Ethernet (eth0).
In the second case, please plug in the ethernet cable with your client
device NOW.

If we have to restart TorBox's wireless network, please reconnect your
client without closing the ssh session. Usually, the configuration
continuous -- if not, then please repeat the process.

Would you like to CONTINUE?
