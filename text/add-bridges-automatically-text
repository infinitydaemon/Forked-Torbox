With this menu entry, you can ADD OBFS4 BRIDGES AUTOMATICALLY. OBFS4 Bridges are necessary for TorBox to bypass Tor blocking in a country.

IMPORTANT
- TorBox is not always able to catch an OBFS4 bridge. If it stuck for
  several minutes, press CTR-C and add the bridges manually.
- For security reasons, only one OBFS4 bridge is acquired about every
  24 hours.
