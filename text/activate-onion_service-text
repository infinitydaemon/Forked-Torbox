By setting up an Onion Service, you can easily and securely share your data through Tor, even if you are behind firewalls, network address translators or in a censoring country, while preserving the security and anonymity of both parties.

This menu entry will check if the requested deactivated Onion Service exists and activates it for you. To see all available Onion Services, use menu entry 4. If the requested Onion Service is not existing, it will be created.
