With this menu entry, you can ADD OBFS4 BRIDGES MANUALLY. OBFS4 Bridges are necessary for TorBox to bypass Tor blocking in a country.

With the help of this dialogue-based configuration assistant, 3-5 OBFS4 bridges can easily be added. When adding more than 5 OBFS4 bridges, it is recommended to use the advanced configuration editor (menu entry 7).

HOW TO OBTAIN OBFS4 BRIDGES?
With TorBox, you have four ways to obtain bridges:
1. Obtain about every 24h one OBFS4 bridge automatically.
2. Get them here: https://bridges.torproject.org/
   (chose "Advanced Options", "obfs4" and press "Get Bridges).
3. Send an email to bridges@torproject.org, using an address from Riseup
   or Gmail with "get transport obfs4" in the body of the mail.
4. (Not recommended, only if needed): Via Telegram: https://t.me/tor_bridges
