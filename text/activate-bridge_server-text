By setting up an OBFS4 bridge relay, you can help censored users connect to the open internet through Tor. To successfully set up an OBFS4 bridge relay, you have to meet some requirements:

- At least 1 Mbit/s down-/upload bandwidth
  (check here: http://beta.speedtest.net)
- 24/7 Internet connectivity for a longer time (weeks or months)
- The ability to expose TCP ports to the internet (make sure that
  NAT doesn't get in the way)

Furthermore, you probably wish to change the configuration (menu entry 3). To take effect, finally, you have to restart Tor (menu entry 7).
More information can you find in the "RUN AN OBFS4BRIDGE RELAY - READ ME FIRST" menu entry.
