This permanently deletes Bridge Relay data, meaning:
- deactivate the use of the bridge relay,
- delete your bridge relay, (hashed) fingerprints etc.

We will NOT...
...delete or reset the configuration files,
...deactivate the use of bridges and delete your bridges,
...delete all circuits and force a change of the permanent entry node,
...delete the Tor statistics.

Are you sure to permanently delete Bridge Relay data?
