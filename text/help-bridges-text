WHAT ARE BRIDGES AND PLUGGABLE TRANSPORTS?
- Direct access to the Tor network may sometimes be blocked by your
  Internet Service Provider or government. Tor includes some circumvention
  tools for getting around these blocks. These tools are called
  BRIDGES and PLUGGABLE TRANSPORTS.
- Bridges, unlike ordinary relays, are not listed publicly, so an adversary
  cannot identify them easily.
- Using bridges in combination with pluggable transports helps disguise the
  fact that someone is using Tor but may slow down the connection compared
  to ordinary Tor relays.
- TorBox only uses bridges WITH pluggable transports, as they help you
  bypass censorship against Tor and, at the same time, are being more
  secure than ordinary bridges.

TYPE OF PLUGGABLE TRANSPORTS:
- OBFS4 is a randomizing transport. It adds an extra layer of specialized
  encryption that makes Tor traffic look like random bytes. It also resists
  active-probing attacks, where the censor discovers bridges by trying to
  connect to them. obfs3 and scramblesuit are similar in nature to obfs4
  but less successful and therefore not integrated into TorBox.
- MEEK-AZURE makes Tor traffic look like a connection to an HTTPS website.
  Unlike the other transports, it doesn't connect directly to a bridge.
  Instead, Meek first connects to a real HTTPS web server (in the Microsoft
  Azure cloud) and from there connects to the actual bridge. Censors cannot
  easily block Meek connections because the HTTPS servers also provide many
  other useful services.
- SNOWFLAKE sends your traffic through WebRTC, a peer-to-peer protocol with
  built-in NAT punching. For censored users: If the Snowflake proxy gets
  blocked, the broker will find a new proxy automatically.

WHICH PLUGGABLE TRANSPORT SHOULD I USE?
- Countries with moderate internet censorship: OBFS4
- China or countries with similar internet censorship: SNOWFLAKE or MEEK

HOW TO ACTIVATE OBFS4?
Just use menu entry 2 or 3.

HOW TO ACTIVATE SNOWFLAKE?
Just use menu entry 8.

HOW TO ACTIVATE MEEK-AZURE?
Just use menu entry 9.

WHICH PLUGGABLE TRANSPORT I'M CURRENTLY USING?
Check the top right corner of the menu. It should display "Bridge mode OFF!" if no bridges and pluggable transports are used or the name of the currently used pluggable transport.

HOW CAN I CHECK THE VALIDITY OF AN OBFS4BRIDGE?
Use menu entry 4 or go to https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html and search for the fingerprint (this is the long number between the ip:port and cert=). Tor Metrics should then show you the information of that particular server. If it doesn't show up, the bridge is no longer valid.

HOW DO I KNOW IF IT IS WORKING?
Check the terminal output when tor is restarting. PLEASE BE PATIENT! The process to build circuits could last for several minutes, depending on your network! At the end, you should see "Bootstrapped 100%: Done".
