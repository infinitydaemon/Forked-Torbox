In highly authoritarian countries connecting the tor network could be seen
as suspicious. OBFS4 bridges with pluggable transports hide the connection
to the tor network. However, we recommend only using this option if
necessary because it is slower and doesn't work if you are behind a
tightly configured firewall.

Choosing this option, TorBox tries to activate its internal OBFS4 bridges.
If this fails, we will try to activate a possible measure against a
tightly configured firewall. If this fails too, we start the
Countermeasure sub-menu so that you can try SNOWFLAKE, MEEK or manually
add new OBFS4 bridge information.

Again, we highlight that if your well-being depends on your anonymity, it
is strongly advised not to use TorBox, but Tails!

Are you located in a highly authoritarian country and need to ACTIVATE
OBFS4 bridges with pluggable transports for TorBox (default is NO)?
