This menu entry deactivates TorBox's OBFS4 BRIDGE RELAY, which is the default.

However, the used configuration will not be deleted. If you activate the OBFS4 BRIDGE RELAY again, the same configuration will be applied -- no need to worry ;-)

At the end, Tor automatically restarts.

Would you like to DEACTIVATE the TorBox's OBFS4 BRIDGE RELAY?
