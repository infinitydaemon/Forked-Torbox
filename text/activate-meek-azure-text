MEEK-AZURE circumvents sophisticated censorship. In contrast to the OBFS4 bridges (see menu entries above), MEEK-AZURE is based on another technique, which should also work for users in China.

You should only activate MEEK-AZURE, if necessary and if OBFS4 bridges don't work. MEEK-AZURE could lead to a less stable and slower data transfer speed. SNOWFLAKE seems to be more performant than MEEK-AZURE, but it is currently in an experimental status. By default, MEEK-AZURE is deactivated.

IMPORTANT
- This menu entry activates MEEK-AZURE to bypass Tor blocking in a
  country. It helps to circumvent censorship; however, it doesn't help if
  a firewall blocks the network traffic.
- OBFS4 BRIDGE and BRIDGE RELAY MODE will automatically be deactivated;
  the configuration will be kept for later re-activation.
- The countermeasure against tightly configured firewalls will
  automatically be deactivated, and local clearnet DNS resolution will
	be activated. However, this is not a problem because all clients'
	DNS requests are still handled through Tor.
- Ignore all the error messages. At the end, you should see
  "Bootstrapped 100%: Done".
- Tor Statistics (and probably some other tools) will not work under
  MEEK-AZURE.
